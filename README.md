## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ What is a Web Worker?

A Web Worker allows you to run scripts in the background, freeing up the main thread to improve performance. This is particularly useful for heavy tasks so that your application remains responsive.

### ❓ Why should I benchmark string transfers?

Benchmarking helps you identify the best method for transferring strings in your web applications. It can lead to improved performance and a better user experience.
